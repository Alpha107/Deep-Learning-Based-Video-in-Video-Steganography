# Deep-Learning-Based-Video-in-Video-Steganography
Videosteganography, the art of concealing secret information within innocuous video files,has emerged as a promising technique for covert 
data transmission. However, traditional video steganography methods are often plagued by limitations, including lowpayload capacity,
noticeable visual distortions that could raise suspicion, and vulnerability to modern steganalysis techniques designed to detect the 
presence of hidden data.

In today's digital age, keeping sensitive information secure is crucial, especially in fields like military operations, intelligence, and business transactions. Video steganography offers a way to hide secret data within ordinary video files, allowing for covert data transmission. However, traditional methods often have drawbacks such as low data capacity, visible distortions that could raise suspicions, and vulnerability to detection techniques.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly with CNNs and RNNs, have revolutionized how we handle complex data like images, videos, and time-series data. These advanced neural networks can capture intricate patterns and representations, making them ideal for developing more effective video steganography techniques. By using these models, we can hide larger amounts of data while maintaining video quality and avoiding detection by steganalysis methods. This is particularly useful in situations requiring covert transmission of large amounts of sensitive information.

Moreover, videos add complexity due to their temporal nature, making it harder for detection algorithms to find and extract hidden data. Despite the effectiveness of current methods, there hasn't been much exploration into hiding one video inside another. Traditional approaches rely on techniques like modified LSB, DCT, and DWT transform. This gap motivates us to explore deep learning for video-in-video steganography, aiming to enhance security and data capacity in covert multimedia communication. This innovative approach offers a robust solution for secure data transmission and protection.

# Aim and Scope of the Project:
In the realm of digital concealment techniques, image and audio steganography face inherent limitations in terms of the amount of data they can hide without compromising quality. This restriction necessitates heavy compression of payloads, which often leads to noticeable distortions and loss of quality in the concealed content. Video steganography addresses this challenge by offering a higher payload capacity. It allows for embedding extensive data within a single cover video, leveraging higher bitrate compression to minimize distortion and preserve overall video quality.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a specialized convolutional autoencoder architecture designed specifically for embedding video frames and audio segments within other videos. This approach aims to conceal significant volumes of data covertly within videos, ensuring that the quality and size of the cover video remain perceptually unchanged.

The scope of the project encompasses the implementation of a deep learning-driven system tailored for video-in-video steganography. Key objectives include securely embedding one video within another to safeguard sensitive video data. This technique also supports the embedding of digital watermarks containing ownership information, thereby preventing unauthorized use or distribution of intellectual property. In sectors such as military and intelligence, video steganography plays a critical role in securely transmitting classified information, ensuring confidentiality while evading detection of sensitive data.
